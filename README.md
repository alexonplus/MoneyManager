Budget TrackerðŸ’µ


Budget Tracker is a simple console application written in C# that allows users to manage their personal finances.
It supports adding income and expense transactions, viewing all transactions, calculating the total balance, and deleting entries.
The app also uses Spectre.Console to provide a colorful, interactive console menu.

## Classes

The project uses the following classes:

| Class Name       | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Transaction`   | Represents a single financial transaction. Stores Description, Amount, Category, and Date. Includes `ShowInfo()` method to display transaction details with color. |
| `BudgetManager` | Manages a list of `Transaction` objects. Provides methods to add, delete, show all transactions, calculate balance, and get statistics. |
| `Program`       | Contains the main program flow. Handles interactive console menu using Spectre.Console and connects user input with `BudgetManager`. |

How did classes and methods help you organize the program?
Using classes and methods made the program much easier to structure and understand. Each class had a specific responsibility â€” for example, the Transaction class handled individual transactions, while the BudgetManager managed all of them together. Methods helped to divide the logic into smaller, reusable parts, such as adding, deleting, or showing transactions. This made the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and simpler to test.


Which part of the project was the most challenging?
The most challenging part was designing the menu and user interaction using Spectre.Console. It required some learning to display text, colors, and menu navigation correctly in the console. Another challenge was making sure all parts â€” like adding and deleting transactions â€” worked smoothly together without errors.
